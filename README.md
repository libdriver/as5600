## LibDriver AS5600

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/as5600/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

The AS5600 is an easy to program magnetic rotary position sensor with a high-resolution 12-bit analog or PWM output. This contactless system measures the absolute angle of a diametric magnetized on-axis magnet. This AS5600 is designed for contactless potentiometer applications and its robust design eliminates the influence of any homogenous external stray magnetic fields.The industry-standard I²C interface supports simple user programming of non-volatile parameters without requiring a dedicated programmer.By default the output represents a range from 0 to 360 degrees.It is also possible to define a smaller range to the output by programming a zero angle (start position) and a maximum angle (stop position).The AS5600 is also equipped with a smart low power mode feature to automatically reduce the power consumption.An input pin (DIR) selects the polarity of the output with regard to rotation direction. If DIR is connected to ground, the output value increases with clockwise rotation. If DIR is connected to VDD, the output value increases with counterclockwise rotation.

LibDriver AS5600 is the AS5600 full function driver launched by LibDriver.It provides magnetic angle reading and other functions. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver AS5600 source files.

/interface includes LibDriver AS5600 IIC platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver AS5600 driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver AS5600 sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver AS5600 offline document.

/datasheet includes AS5600 datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface IIC platform independent template and finish your platform IIC driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_as5600_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint32_t i;
uint32_t times;

/* basic init */
res = as5600_basic_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...
    
/* get the times */
times = 10;

for (i = 0; i < times; i++)
{
    float deg;

    /* read data */
    res = as5600_basic_read(&deg);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)as5600_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }

    /* output */
    as5600_interface_debug_print("as5600: angle is %.2f.\n", deg);

    /* delay 1000ms */
    as5600_interface_delay_ms(1000);
    
    ...
}

...
    
/* deinit */
(void)as5600_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```
